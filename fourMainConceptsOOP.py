1. What are the four main concepts of OOP, and how do they work?
    - Abstraction:
        - important because it simplfies programming process. Works by only
        displaying data that is relevant to your goal and hides the complex details.
    - Inheritance:
        - just like what it sounds, when a class is able to inherit the properties and characteristics of another class
    - Encapsulation:
        - Class that conceals data fields and methods that achieve functions, though become accessible through access modifiers
    - Polymorphism
        - runtime Polymorphism:
        - compile-time Polymorphism:
        Its process assigns the value or behavior of something in a subclass to something that was already defined in the main class."
